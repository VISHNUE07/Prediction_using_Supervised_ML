# Linear Regression Prediction - Student Scores
## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of an internship task with The Sparks Foundation. The objective was to implement a supervised machine learning model using Linear Regression to predict student scores based on the number of study hours. The task involves predicting the percentage of a student’s score from the number of hours studied and making a specific prediction for a student who studies for 9.25 hours per day.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task consists of two variables:

* Hours: Number of hours studied by the student.
* Scores: Percentage of the student’s score.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project were:
* To create a Linear Regression model to predict student scores based on study hours.
* To visualize the relationship between study hours and scores.
* To predict the score for a student who studies for 9.25 hours per day.

## Methodology
1. Data Preparation:
* Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.
* Split the data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
2. Linear Regression Model:
* Implemented the Linear Regression algorithm using Scikit-Learn.
* Trained the model on the training data and evaluated its performance using appropriate metrics.
3. Visualization:
* Created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between study hours and student scores.
* Plotted the regression line to show how the model predicts scores based on study hours.
4. Prediction:
* Used the trained model to predict the score for a student studying 9.25 hours per day.

## Results
* The Linear Regression model was successfully trained and evaluated, demonstrating a good fit for predicting student scores based on study hours.
* The model’s visualization shows a clear linear relationship between study hours and scores, indicating that the model is effectively capturing the trend.
* The predicted score for a student who studies for 9.25 hours per day was calculated, providing a practical example of the model’s predictive capability.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas for data manipulation
* Scikit-Learn for implementing the Linear Regression algorithm
* Matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing the data and regression line

## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of Linear Regression for predicting student performance based on study hours. The model effectively captures the linear relationship between study hours and scores, and the prediction for 9.25 hours of study demonstrates the model's practical utility.
